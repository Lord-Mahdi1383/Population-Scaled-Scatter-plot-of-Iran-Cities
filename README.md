# Population Scaled Scatter plot of Iran Cities
This Python script creates a population-scaled map visualization of major Iranian cities using Basemap and Matplotlib. The size and color of each city marker corresponds to its population, providing an intuitive geographical representation of population distribution across Iran.

## Features
- **Population-proportional markers**: Circle sizes dynamically represent city populations
- **Professional cartography**: Uses Basemap with accurate Mercator projection
- **Custom styling**: Clean labels, plasma color gradient, and optimized layout
- **Multi-format support**: Works with Excel (.xlsx) and CSV files
- **Geographical context**: Includes coastlines, country borders, and regional boundaries
- **Automated data processing**: Converts Excel to CSV with single command
